    * Allow publisher to always publish by setting the threshold to zero.
    On documentation (https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/topic_based_ros2_control/blob/main/doc/user.md)
    trigger_joint_command_threshold can be configuration with zero so that the allow publisher to
    always send the joint command.
    However, in the code the condition was set with:
    ```
    if (diff <= trigger_joint_command_threshold\_)
    {
    return hardware_interface::return_type::OK;
    }
    ```
    In case trigger_joint_command_threshold_ is set to zero, diff can still be zero so
    it will not trigger the send.
    This PR tries to address the above mentioned case.
    * Revert "Allow publisher to always publish by setting the threshold to zero."
    This reverts commit a799b539d877d1a2ca7203f5d57bc4c805df7202.
    * Update the documentation instead (-1).
